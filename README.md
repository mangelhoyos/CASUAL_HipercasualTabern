# Hipercasual Tabern
Hypercasual minigame made in Unity where you are an innkeeper and need to feed the orcs before they get angry, achieving better scores each time you try to bypass your friends. The game contains a connection to a local database based on a RestAPI Express JS connection to a MySQL DB.
